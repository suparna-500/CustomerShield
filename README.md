# CustomerShield
CustomerShield is a customer churn prediction project where I built a machine learning model using the Telco dataset to identify customers at risk of leaving. The goal is to analyze behavior patterns and support businesses in improving customer retention.

CustomerShield is a customer churn prediction project where I plan to build a machine learning model to identify customers who are likely to leave a telecom service.

The goal is to analyze customer behavior patterns and help businesses make smarter retention decisions.

This project will include:

Data analysis and preprocessing

Model training using LightGBM

Model evaluation

Deployment using Streamlit_


Problem Statement

Customer churn directly impacts company revenue and growth. Instead of reacting after customers leave, this project focuses on predicting churn in advance using customer demographic and service usage data.

The objective of this project is to:

Analyze customer behavior and subscription patterns

Identify key factors contributing to churn

Build machine learning models to classify churn risk

Evaluate model performance using proper classification metrics

Dataset

The project uses the IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset from Kaggle.

The dataset contains:

Customer demographic information

Service subscription details

Contract type and payment method

Monthly and total charges

Churn label (Yes/No)

Dataset Note

The dataset is included inside the data/ folder for development purposes.

Expected file path:

data/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv

Project Goals

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Handle categorical encoding and feature scaling

Train baseline and advanced machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM)

Evaluate model performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

Deploy the final model using Streamlit
